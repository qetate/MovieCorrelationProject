# Movie Data Analysis Project (Correlation)

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform data cleaning and analysis on a [movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies) to uncover meaningful correlations, particularly focusing on the relationship between movie budgets and gross earnings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Matplotlib**: Library used for creating visualizations in Python.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating scatter plots, regression plots, and heatmaps to visualize correlations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating data to discover patterns and check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring the relationships between different numeric features of the dataset.
